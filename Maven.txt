Install java 

Download and run Java 
copy path of jdk bin 
Go to system setting->Advanced syatem setting ->env variables
In env variables add path and in system variables add variable name as JAVA_HOME and value as path(excluding bin)

In cmd check --- java -version

Maven 

Download apache maven 
copy path of maven bin 
Go to system setting->Advanced syatem setting ->env variables
In env variables add path and in system variables add variable name as JAVA_HOME and value as path(excluding bin)

IN gitbash check- mvn
                - mvn -version

Maven Goals :
- validate
- compile
- test-compile(test classes )
- test(test cases)
- package(.jar, .war)
- verify (to run integration test after build)
- install (build gets copied in local repo--(c drive .m2))
- Deploy(to another server)
- clean 

Frequently used :
maven clean install
maven clean package 


Install eclipse

eclipse (used by developer to develop code)

create new java project->maven project
proj name : first_project
Filter: maven-archetype-quickstart
grp Id : com
Artifact Id : firstproject 
version :
Package gets created as com.firstpackage

mvn compile (classes get created except for test )
mvn test-compile(classes get created including test)
mvn clean 
mvn package(jar gets created)


To run a build appication(got to target folder)
java -jar <jarname> 

pom.xml -  all dependencies will be declared here and are downloaded in .m2 folder                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Transitive dependency :
we want dependency but that dependency depends on other dependencies

while pushing the project on to git exclude the target folder where the build will be done
